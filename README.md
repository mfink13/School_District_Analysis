# PyCitySchools Challenge
## Overview of the school district analysis
	
  This project was initiated to analyze the schools’ data within a district in order to determine if funds needed to be reallocated, based on passing percentages of math and reading scores, as well as student population per school.

### Purpose
	
  The purpose of the challenge part of the analysis was to nullify the tampered data from the Thomas High School 9th grade class and then re-run the analysis with the updates.

## Results 
  - How is the district summary affected?

	The district summary was not affected enough to change the math, reading, or overall passing percentages, when rounded to a whole number.
    
  - How is the school summary affected?
